            (Cut to the Engineer sitting on his toolbox and playing 'More Gun' on his guitar. Next to him is a kill counter displaying 209. The Engineer is sitting in the bend of one of the pathways between the Warehouse and the Radar Dish in Hydro.)
            
            Engineer: Hey look, buddy, I'm an Engineer. That means I solve problems.
            
            (A gunshot ricochets off the truck near the Engineer; he ignores it.)
            
            Engineer: Not problems like "What is beauty?", because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.
            
            (Two more gunshots ricochet off the truck, close to the Engineer's head. He glances briefly at the bullet holes.)
            
            Engineer: I solve practical problems.
            
            (The Engineer takes a bottle of beer from a nearby crate and swigs it as the level 1 Sentry Gun near him swivels round and shoots an unseen Heavy.)
            
            Heavy: (screams)
            
            (The Engineer puts down the beer and continues to play. The Kill counter clicks up from 209 to 210.)
            
            Engineer: Fr'instance...
            
            (The camera shows a BLU Sniper in the background trying to sneak up on the Engineer)
            
            Engineer: ...How am I going to stop some big mean mother hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous new behind?
            
            (The Sentry Gun spots the Sniper and kills him. The Kill counter clicks up to 211.)
            
            Engineer: The answer...
            
            (A level 2 Sentry Gun fires and kills a Scout and an unseen enemy.)
            
            Scout: (screams)
            
            (Kill counter clicks up to 213)
            
            Engineer: ...use a gun. And if that don't work.... [A level 3 sentry gun fires rockets] ...use more gun.
            
            (The Engineer stops playing. A large explosion is heard and the Engineer grins happily.)
            
            Unknown Assailant: My arm! (from off-screen)
            
            (The Kill counter clicks up to 214. A severed Sniper hand lands in front of the Engineer; the level 1 Sentry Gun follows the hand, while the Engineer continues playing.)
            
            Engineer: Like this heavy caliber, tripod-mounted, little ol' number designed by me...
            
            (The Engineer kicks the hand away, which is shot out of the air by the level 1 Sentry Gun.)
            
            Engineer: ...Built by me...
            
            (The level 1 Sentry Gun an off-screen Soldier. The Kill Counter clicks up to 215.)
            
            Engineer: ...and you'd best hope... not pointed at you.
            
            (The camera zooms out from the Engineer as his Sentry Guns continue to devastate the attackers. It is revealed that the Engineer's truck is crammed full of BLU Intelligence, and that his "campfire" is in fact the burning body of a BLU Sniper.)
            
            (Various screams)
            
            (The Engineer's guitar sounds blend into the ambiance, before the piece ends with the Team Fortress 2 ending flourish.)</marquee>

                    <!--Befitting their motto, "We sell products and get in fights", Mann Co. is known for their weapons, munitions, and cosmetic lines. They have long published trade catalogs, including the early The Zepheniah Mann & Sons Co. Quarterly Concern, a "compendium of broad swords, musket guns and doomsday weaponry for immediate sale", and the more recent Dapper Rogue, a catalog for the "gentleman scoundrel". The Administrator has been known to make use of the company for custom orders via her assistant Miss Pauling. In the Gravel War, Mann Co. was the sole supplier to Reliable Excavation Demolition and Builders League United. In the subsequent Robot War, Mann Co. opened sales of advanced technologies to the mercenaries. Mann Co. products, at least those promoted to low-end markets (especially to employees), have a reputation for quality and safety issues. Products tend to break down, catch on fire (although Saxton Hale claimed that that's how he knows the products are working), and melt into people's skulls. Mann Co. was also the subject of two Senate investigations, one in relation to their alleged part in the tragic destruction of American monkeynaut Poopy Joe's capsule during takeoff and the other in relation to teaching boys aged 6-16, among other things, moral turpitude, arson, vandalism, hippie assault, tax fraud, at-home laryngectomies, car theft, gorilla slaughter, and the Heimlich Maneuver (which had just been invented and was still considered controversial). Mann Co. went "online" after Saxton Hale discovered the existence of the Internet when one of his employees, who was losing a fight against a gorilla during "Gorilla Wrestling Fridays", asked for his mother to be notified by email. Saxton Hale currently owns England due to the Internet venture. The Mann Co. Store was created as well – a way for customers to buy hats, weapons, bundles, and other miscellaneous items for real currency-->

                    <!--BLU (Builders League United) is a subsidiary of TF Industries, which allegedly specializes in "construction operations". BLU has considerable land in the New Mexican Badlands and appears to dabble in numerous industries, the most notable of which is the mining of gravel. They are led by their founder and CEO Blutarch Mann. Beneath the convincing exterior of their bases of operations can be found computer racks, satellites, rockets, and missile installations. They put a considerable amount of wealth towards militarization in the hopes of defeating their rivals, RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition). Each corporation administers its half of the world with a multi-disciplined army of paper pushers. For any problem lacking an obvious bureaucratic solution, mercenaries are contracted to address the situation through a massive application of force. Conflicts between the two companies began as land disputes between their leaders continued for about a century until 1971, with the death of Redmond and Blutarch. BLU and RED share an intense rivalry, with nearly all encounters between the two quickly escalating into brutal and often fatal violence. Inter-company friendship is also strictly forbidden by contract. Despite this, the BLU Soldier and the RED Demoman at one time became fast friends after meeting each other at a projectile weapons expo. Once this was brought to the attention of the Administrator, however, she pitted them against each other in a deadly competition that promised a mysterious new item to the winner, twisting their former friendship into a bloody war. BLU favors a more industrial style of architecture than RED. BLU's dress code, however, is rather liberal, requiring that employees adopt a blue motif for easy identification. This could also be for identification by Sentry Guns, as well as other buildings. The Administrator terminated the Director's interviews just before he started with the BLU team; so, in the Team Fortress 2 shorts by Valve, BLU usually is killed or defeated by RED.-->
